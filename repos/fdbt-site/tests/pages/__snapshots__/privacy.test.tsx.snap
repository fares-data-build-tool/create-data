    Privacy policy for the Create Fares Data Service

    Who we are
  </h2>
  <p
    className="govuk-body"
  >
    The Create Fares Data service allows users to convert their fares information into a format called NeTEx, which is an XML-based data standard. The service provides an easy-to-use webflow that takes the user through a series of questions, allowing them to define their fare prices and structures. In order to make the process as simple as possible, we utilise data from Traveline National Dataset (TNDS), NaPTAN dataset and National Operator Code (NOC) database to represent bus operator routes and services to the user. The aim of the tool is to integrate closely with the Bus Open Data Service (BODS) in the publication of fares data.

  </h2>
  <p
    className="govuk-body"

    We use your data to occasionally check your activity when using the service. We will not:

    <li>
      share your data with third parties for marketing purposes

    We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. This includes IP addresses. The data is anonymised before being used for analytics processing. Google Analytics processes anonymised information about:
  </p>

    We do not store your personal information through Google Analytics (for example your name or address). We will not identify you through analytics information, and we will not combine analytics information with other data sets in a way that would identify who you are. We continuously test and monitor our data protection controls to make sure they’re effective and to detect any weaknesses.

    Where your data is processed and stored
  </h2>
  <p
    className="govuk-body"

    We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored. Your personal data will not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

  </h2>
  <p
    className="govuk-body"

    We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place technical and organisational procedures to secure the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with have an obligation to keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.
