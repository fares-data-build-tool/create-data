# Raise a Bug or Defect

Defects/Bugs will be classified if it falls into any of the following:

- When actual result deviates from the expected result while testing the software application or product, it results into a defect or bug.
- When the result of the product does not meet with the end user expectations or the software requirements, it also results into a Bug or Defect.

## Defect Prioritisation and Category

During the UAT phase, the TfN Test Lead will serve as a liaison between the UAT Team and the supplier in matters of prioritizing the defects found. The defects will be assigned to the relevant service level (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5) as defined in the requirements/contract, as seen in the table below:

| Priority ("P") Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Determined as > 1% of enquiries from APIs not recorded; or All faults resulting in system response times falling below the following levels outlined in the System Performance section (requirements T2-Req-NF105 and T2-Req-NF106) specifically: The Service API shall respond to 95% of SIRI SX requests within 250ms; and The Service API shall respond to 99.9% of SIRI SX requests within 750ms. |
| Priority 2           | Functionality of the Service is severely degraded, or major components of the Service are not operational and work cannot reasonably continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Priority 3           | Certain non-essential features of the Service are impaired while most major components of the Service remain functional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Priority 4           | Errors that are non-disabling or cosmetic and clearly have little or no impact on the normal operation of the Services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Defect resolution

Addressing defects should be part of definition of done. For a story to proceed through to deployment, any defects raised by testers should be addressed by the developer, by going through the defect resolution process as seen below:

- New: New Bug Raised by Tester, and assigned to Developer.
- Dev In Progress: Developer picks up the defect, and agrees to investigate. This is assigned Dev in progress by the developer.
- Pending Testing: Developer reassigns bug to Tester for retesting.
- Test in Progress: Tester has picked the defect up and is working on it.
- Resolved: Tester has retested and happy that the bug is resolved.
- Reassigned: This Status will be used by Tester if Retesting has taken place and bug is still not resolved.
- Closed: The bug is closed, no issues.
