# Disable Site Auth for Testing

When running the site locally, or on the test environment, you can append ‘?disableAuth=true’ to the URL, and hit enter, and when the page re-renders, you will have the necessary session attributes and cookies set to progress through the site.

A useful plugin when running the site is [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en) which will enable you to reset your session when needed.
