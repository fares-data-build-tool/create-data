## Important notes

- The NaPTAN code is not yet needed but field is in there so we can pre-populate interim stops between fare stages at a later stage, this was identified during our workshop with users as a possible way to save them time and aid data entry
- The fare stage names could be bus stop names or numbers, or letters e.g fare stage 1, 2, 3 or A, B, C
