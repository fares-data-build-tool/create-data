# Developer Conventions

- One person "owns" ticket from ToDo to Done
  - Owner asks for review
  - Owner merges
  - Owner asks for testing on test environment
  - Owner pushes through to prod (wherever sensible)
- Jira:
  - Person developing/reviewing/testing/releasing has their face on the ticket
- Branch naming - we’re not too strict here, but something along the lines of:
  - `feat/CFD-123-blah-blah-blah`
  - `feat/cfd-123-some-description-of-task` (_easiest to type as no capitals or underscores and still links through to JIRA_)
  - `fix/CFD-123_blah_blah_blah`
- Commit naming:
  - e.g. `feat: CFD-123 blah blah blah (#22)`
  - Follow [www.conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) [see table below](#conventional-commits)
- Raising PR:
  - Testing instructions just for quirks, nothing too prescriptive - give room for exploratory testing by the reviewer/tester
- Merge:
  - Merged by owner after approved by necessary reviewers
  - ‘Squash and merge’ for dev PRs
  - ‘Merge commit’ for preprod PRs
- Ready for release column:
  - Ticket moves here once tested on test environment
  - Can then be pushed preprod -> prod
  - Can wait for other tickets to bulk release if this makes sense
