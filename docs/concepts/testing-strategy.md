[Defect or bug raising method is detailed here](../guides/raise-a-bug-or-defect.md)

| Type of Testing             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Time                                                                                                    | When do they run?                                              | Responsibility/Domain                                             |

| Unit Tests                  | Tests written within the code to ensure a method or piece of code works as we want it to.                                                                                                                                             | A few seconds.                                                                                          | Multiple times throughout the lifecycle of the code.           | IW, as they will be within the code repo.                         |
| Component Integration Tests | Tests written within the code to ensure different modules of the code work with each other, in a more business-centric fashion. For example, an IT test might be named “shouldRepondWithAcceptedWhenUserProvidesCorrectData”.         | Longer than unit tests, potentially 30 seconds or so (as it needs to ‘spin’ up the system to run them). | Multiple times throughout the lifecycle of the code.           | IW, as they will be within the code repo.                         |
| System Integration Tests    | Tests written to ensure that external dependencies are available if they are to be used within our process (for example the fares reference data or the Open Data Hub).                                                               | A few seconds.                                                                                          | Multiple times throughout the lifecycle of the code.           | IW, as they will be within the code repo.                         |
| UI Smoke Tests              | Very lightweight mocks of a user using the system in a “Happy Path” way, i.e. no perceived problems.                                                                                                                                  | 2-3 minutes per test at most.                                                                           | When the code runs through our build tool, and also on demand. | IW, as the UI test framework will be set up and maintained by us. |
| Browser Tests               | To be combined with the UI Tests, so it will run the UI tests on the first browser, then the next etc etc.                                                                                                                            | As long as the UI tests take, but per browser version.                                                  | When the code runs through our build tool, and also on demand. | IW, as per UI tests above.                                        |
| Performance                 | TBC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | TBC                                                                                                     | TBC                                                            | TBC                                                               |
| Security                    | TBC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | TBC                                                                                                     | TBC                                                            | TBC                                                               |
| Contract                    | TBC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | TBC                                                                                                     | TBC                                                            | TBC                                                               |
| Manual Smoke Tests          | Checking that the code does what we expect from a user point of view, which means running it locally / on a test environment, and having a quick once over. Evidencing of testing is done here, in the form of videos or screenshots. | Depends on the ticket, 5 mins to 30 mins.                                                               | Before tickets are signed off to go to UAT.                    | IW                                                                |
| UAT                         | Manual testing done by TfN (for example by Olu or Divesh) in the preprod environment. To be led by the evidence from the manual smoke tests and the information on the ticket.                                                        | Depends on the ticket, 5 mins to 30 mins.                                                               | Once IW has said something is ready to be checked.             | TfN.                                                              |
